# Asteroids-Clone
First major assignment of year 1 of my Games Programming course

Goal of assignment was to produce an Asteroids close using API of my choice (Allegro 5 in this case) with as many features as desired. This was my first game programmed in C++ and my first major piece of work and I am very pleased with
the outcome in terms of playability of the game and number of features I managed to include e.g. good graphics and sound, very few bugs, local multiplayer, hi score table etc.
